An AI-generated beats library

## Functionality

Plan is to have 2 main features:

1. A library of pre-generated AI beats
2. A way to generate artist type beats using https://www.stableaudio.com/ (according to https://stability.ai/news/stable-audio-2-0 they should release an API at some point)
   It is unfeasible to fine-tune a model for several artist type beats right now, and I doubt the audiocraft models will be good enough
